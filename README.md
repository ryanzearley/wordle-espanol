*  `e.key` is more straightforward than charcodes
* `async` and `await` can be used to wait for `Promises` of API data to resolve
*  Reference classes and `querySelectorAll()` can be used to add CSS animation classes
*  `tabIndex={0}` can be used to allow non-input elements to be focused by the keyboard
*  `map()` can be used twice for nested arrays
